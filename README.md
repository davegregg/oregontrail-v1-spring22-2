# Abstraction
    - Describing something else in a simpler or more flexible way.
    - Indirection: Indirectly dealing with something, in the hopes of simplifying how we work with it, or working with it more flexibly, or without it having to be present.

# Encapsulation
    - "putting something in a capsule/container and the benefits we get from it"
      - Grouping things together
      - You know where to find those things
      - You can make it more secure
    - **Encapsulation** is bundling data together, perhaps along with tools for working with that data, protecting the data from being accessed or changed unexpectedly.

# Polymorphism
    - "poly-": multiple or many
    - "-morph-": change or variation or shape
    - Same command/message, possibly different results
    - Telling kids "It is time to go home": they may go to different places, by different means, but they all know to respond/react to the same message.
